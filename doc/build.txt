How to build lxml from source
=============================

To build lxml from source, you need libxml2 and libxslt properly installed,
including header files (possibly shipped in -dev packages).

Pyrex
-----

The lxml.etree and lxml.objectify modules are written in Pyrex_.  Since we
distribute the Pyrex-generated .c files with lxml releases, however, you do
not need Pyrex to build lxml from the normal release sources.

.. _Pyrex: http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

If you are interested in building lxml from a Subversion checkout or want to
be an lxml developer, you do need a working Pyrex installation.

* lxml 1.0 and earlier

  The 1.0 series build with a standard installation of Pyrex 0.9.4.1.  Note
  that Pyrex up to and including version 0.9.4 has known problems when
  compiling lxml with gcc 4.x or Python 2.4.  Do not use it.  If you want to
  build lxml from non-release sources, please install Pyrex version 0.9.4.1 or
  later.

  Pyrex now supports EasyInstall_, so you can install it by running the
  following command as super-user::

      easy_install Pyrex

  .. _EasyInstall: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* lxml 1.1 and later

  Newer versions of lxml depend on features and bug fixes that are not yet
  available in an official Pyrex release.  This includes support for the
  external C-API of lxml, for Python 2.5 and for 64 bit architectures.

  To build lxml 1.1 and later from non-release or modified sources, you must
  therefore install an updated Pyrex version from here:

  http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/pyrex/


Subversion
----------

The lxml package is developed in a Subversion repository.  You can retrieve
the current developer version by calling::

  svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk lxml

This will create a directory ``lxml`` and download the source into it.  You
can also `browse the repository through the web`_ or use your favourite SVN
client to access it.

.. _`browse the repository through the web`: http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml


The distutils approach
----------------------

Usually, building lxml is done through distutils.  Do a Subversion checkout
(or download the source tar-ball and unpack it) and then type::

  python setup.py build

If you want to test lxml from the source directory, it is better to build it
in-place like this::

  python setup.py  build_ext -i

or, in Unix-like environments::

  make

If you get errors about missing header files (e.g., ``libxml/xmlversion.h``)
then you need to add the location of that file to the include path like::

  python setup.py build_ext -i -I /usr/include/libxml2

where the file is in ``/usr/include/libxml2/libxml/xmlversion.h``

To use lxml.etree in-place, you can place lxml's ``src`` directory on your
Python module search path (PYTHONPATH) and then import ``lxml.etree`` to play
with it.

To recompile after changes, note that you may have to run ``make clean`` or
delete the file ``src/lxml/etree.c``.  Distutils do not automatically pick up
changes that affect files other than the main file ``src/lxml/etree.pyx``.


Running the tests and reporting errors
--------------------------------------

The source distribution (tgz) contains a test suite for lxml.  You can run it
from the top-level directory::

  python test.py

Note that the test script only tests the in-place build (see distutils
building above), as it searches the ``src`` directory.  You can use the
following one-step command to trigger an in-place build and test it::

  make clean test

To run the ElementTree and cElementTree compatibility tests, make sure
you have lxml on your PYTHONPATH first, then run::

  python selftest.py

and::

  python selftest2.py

If the tests give failures, errors, or worse, segmentation faults, we'd really
like to know. Please contact us on the `mailing list`_, and please specify the
version of lxml, libxml2, libxslt and Python you were using, as well as your
operating system type (Linux, Windows, MacOs, ...).

.. _`mailing list`: http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/lxml-dev


Contributing an egg
-------------------

This is the procedure to make an lxml egg for your platform:

* download the lxml-x.y.tgz release. This contains the pregenerated C so
  we don't run into any Pyrex issues. Unpack it and cd into it.

* python setup.py build

* if you're on a unixy platform, cd into build/lib.your.platform and
  strip any .so file you find there. This reduces the size of the egg.

* python setup.py bdist_egg upload

The last 'upload' step only works if you have access to the lxml
cheeseshop entry. If not, you can just make an egg with bdist_egg and
mail it to the lxml maintainer.

Static linking on Windows
-------------------------

Most operating systems have proper package management that makes installing
current versions of libxml2 and libxslt easy.  The most famous exception is
Microsoft Windows, which entirely lacks these capabilities.  It can therefore
be interesting to statically link the external libraries into lxml.etree to
avoid having to install them separately.  `David Sankel`_ proposed the
following approach.

.. _`David Sankel`: http://codespeak.net/pipermail/lxml-dev/2006-May/001196.html

Download lxml and all required libraries to the same directory.  The iconv,
libxml2, libxslt, and zlib libraries are all available from the ftp site
ftp://ftp.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/.

Your directory should now have the following files in it (although possibly
different versions)::

  iconv-1.9.1.win32.zip
  libxml2-2.6.23.win32.zip
  libxslt-1.1.15.win32.zip
  lxml-1.0.0.tgz
  zlib-1.2.3.win32.zip

Now extract each of those files in the *same* directory.  This should give you
something like this::

  iconv-1.9.1.win32/
  iconv-1.9.1.win32.zip
  libxml2-2.6.23.win32/
  libxml2-2.6.23.win32.zip
  libxslt-1.1.15.win32/
  libxslt-1.1.15.win32.zip
  lxml-1.0.0/
  lxml-1.0.0.tgz
  zlib-1.2.3.win32/
  zlib-1.2.3.win32.zip

Go to the lxml-1.0.0 directory and edit the file ``setup.py``.  There should
be a section near the top that looks like this::

  def setupStaticBuild():
      cflags = [
          ]
      xslt_libs = [
          ]
      result = (cflags, xslt_libs)
      # return result
      raise NotImplementedError, \
            "Static build not configured, see doc/build.txt"

Change this section to something like this, but take care to use the correct
version numbers::

  def setupStaticBuild():
      cflags = [
         "-I..\\libxml2-2.6.23.win32\\include ",
         "-I..\\libxslt-1.1.15.win32\\include",
         "-I..\\zlib-1.2.3.win32\\include",
         "-I..\\iconv-1.9.1.win32\\include"
         ]
      xslt_libs = [
         "..\\libxml2-2.6.23.win32\\lib\\libxml2_a.lib",
         "..\\libxslt-1.1.15.win32\\lib\\libxslt_a.lib",
         "..\\libxslt-1.1.15.win32\\lib\\libexslt_a.lib",
         "..\\zlib-1.2.3.win32\\lib\\zlib.lib",
         "..\\iconv-1.9.1.win32\\lib\\iconv_a.lib"
         ]
      result = (cflags, xslt_libs)
      return result

The ``_a`` part of the library names means that we are linking statically
against the named library files.  If you want to use dynamic libraries, you
need to link against the DLL version of the libraries.

Now you should be able to pass the ``--static`` option to setup.py and
everything should work well.  Try calling::

  python setup.py bdist_wininst --static

This will create a windows installer in the ``pkg`` directory.


Building Debian packages from SVN sources
-----------------------------------------

`Andreas Pakulat`_ proposed the following approach.

.. _`Andreas Pakulat`: http://codespeak.net/pipermail/lxml-dev/2006-May/001254.html

* ``apt-get source lxml``
* remove the unpacked directory
* tar.gz the lxml SVN version and replace the orig.tar.gz that lies in the
  directory
* check md5sum of created tar.gz file and place new sum and size in dsc file
* do ``dpkg-source -x lxml-...dsc`` and cd into the newly created directory
* run ``dch -i`` and add a comment like "use trunk version", this will
  increase the debian version number so apt/dpkg don't get confused
* run ``dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc`` to build the package

Eventually dpkg-buildpackage will tell you that some dependecies are missing,
you can either install them manually or run apt-get build-dep lxml

That will give you .deb packages in the parent directory which can be
installed using ``dpkg -i``.
