Using custom Element classes in lxml
====================================

lxml has very sophisticated support for custom Element classes.  You can
provide your own classes for Elements and have lxml use them by default or
only for a specific tag name in a specific namespace.

Custom Elements must inherit from the ``lxml.etree.ElementBase`` class, which
provides the Element interface for subclasses::

  >>> from lxml import etree
  >>> class HonkElement(etree.ElementBase):
  ...    def honking(self):
  ...       return self.get('honking') == 'true'
  ...    honking = property(honking)

This defines a new Element class ``HonkElement`` with a property ``honking``.

Note that you cannot (or rather *must not*) instantiate this class yourself.
lxml.etree will do that for you through its normal ElementTree API.


Changing the default element class
----------------------------------

You can let lxml use your new class for every Element it generates::

  >>> etree.setDefaultElementClass(HonkElement)
  >>> el = etree.Element("myelement")
  >>> print isinstance(el, HonkElement)
  True
  >>> el.honking
  False
  >>> el = etree.Element("myelement", honking='true')
  >>> el.honking
  True

To reset lxml.etree to the original element class, pass ``None`` or nothing::

  >>> etree.setDefaultElementClass()
  >>> el = etree.Element("myelement")
  >>> print isinstance(el, HonkElement)
  False


Implementing namespaces
-----------------------

lxml allows you to implement namespaces, in a rather literal sense.  You can
build a new element namespace (or retrieve an existing one) by calling the
Namespace class::

  >>> namespace = etree.Namespace('http://hui.de/honk')

and then register the new element type with that namespace, say, under the tag
name ``honk``::

  >>> namespace['honk'] = HonkElement

After this, you create and use your XML elements through the normal API of
lxml::

  >>> xml = '<honk xmlns="http://hui.de/honk" honking="true"/>'
  >>> honk_element = etree.XML(xml)
  >>> print honk_element.honking
  True

The same works when creating elements by hand::

  >>> honk_element = etree.Element('{http://hui.de/honk}honk',
  ...                              honking='true')
  >>> print honk_element.honking
  True

Essentially, what this allows you to do, is to give elements a custom API
based on their namespace and tag name.

A somewhat related topic are `extension functions`_ which use a similar
mechanism for registering extension functions in XPath and XSLT.

Element initialization
----------------------

There is one thing to remember.  Element classes *must not* have a
constructor, neither must there be any internal state (except for the data
stored in the underlying XML tree).  Element instances are created and garbage
collected at need, so there is no way to predict when and how often a
constructor would be called.  Even worse, when the ``__init__`` method is
called, the object may not even be initialized yet to represent the XML tag,
so there is not much use in providing an ``__init__`` method in subclasses.

However, there is one possible way to do things on element initialization, if
you really need to.  ElementBase classes have an ``_init()`` method that can
be overridden.  It can be used to modify the XML tree, e.g. to construct
special children or verify and update attributes.

The semantics of ``_init()`` are as follows:

* It is called at least once on element instantiation time.  That is, when a
  Python representation of the element is created by lxml.  At that time, the
  element object is completely initialized to represent a specific XML element
  within the tree.

* The method has complete access to the XML tree.  Modifications can be done
  in exactly the same way as anywhere else in the program.

* Python representations of elements may be created multiple times during the
  lifetime of an XML element in the underlying tree.  The ``_init()`` code
  provided by subclasses must take special care by itself that multiple
  executions either are harmless or that they are prevented by some kind of
  flag in the XML tree.  The latter can be achieved by modifying an attribute
  value or by removing or adding a specific child node and then verifying this
  before running through the init process.

* Any exceptions raised in ``_init()`` will be propagated throught the API
  call that lead to the creation of the Element.  So be careful with the code
  you write here as its exceptions may turn up in various unexpected places.


Default implementations
-----------------------

In the Namespace example above, we associated the HonkElement class only with
the 'honk' element.  If an XML tree contains different elements in the same
namespace, they do not pick up the same implementation::

  >>> xml = '<honk xmlns="http://hui.de/honk" honking="true"><bla/></honk>'
  >>> honk_element = etree.XML(xml)
  >>> print honk_element.honking
  True
  >>> print honk_element[0].honking
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'etree._Element' object has no attribute 'honking'

You can therefore provide one implementation per element name in each
namespace and have lxml select the right one on the fly.  If you want one
element implementation per namespace (ignoring the element name) or prefer
having a common class for most elements except a few, you can specify a
default implementation for an entire namespace by registering that class with
the empty element name (None).

You may consider following an object oriented approach here.  If you build a
class hierarchy of element classes, you can also implement a base class for a
namespace that is used if no specific element class is provided.  Again, you
can just pass None as an element name::

  >>> class HonkNSElement(etree.ElementBase):
  ...    def honk(self):
  ...       return "HONK"
  >>> namespace[None] = HonkNSElement

  >>> class HonkElement(HonkNSElement):
  ...    def honking(self):
  ...       return self.get('honking') == 'true'
  ...    honking = property(honking)
  >>> namespace['honk'] = HonkElement

Now you can rely on lxml to always return objects of type HonkNSElement or its
subclasses for elements of this namespace::

  >>> xml = '<honk xmlns="http://hui.de/honk" honking="true"><bla/></honk>'
  >>> honk_element = etree.XML(xml)

  >>> print type(honk_element), type(honk_element[0])
  <class 'HonkElement'> <class 'HonkNSElement'>

  >>> print honk_element.honking
  True
  >>> print honk_element.honk()
  HONK
  >>> print honk_element[0].honk()
  HONK
  >>> print honk_element[0].honking
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'HonkNSElement' object has no attribute 'honking'
