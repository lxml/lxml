lxml.html
=========

Since version 2.0, lxml provides a dedicated package for dealing with HTML:
``lxml.html``.  It provides a special Element API for HTML elements, as well
as a number of utilities for common tasks.

The main API is based on the `lxml.etree`_ API, and thus, on the ElementTree_
API.

Parsing HTML
============

Parsing HTML fragments
----------------------

HTML Element Methods
====================

HTML elements have all the methods that come with ElementTree, but
also include some extra methods:

``.drop_tree()``:
    Drops the element and all its children.  Unlike
    ``el.getparent().remove(el)`` this does *not* remove the tail
    text; with ``drop_tree`` the tail text is merged with the previous
    element.

``.drop_tag()``:
    Drops the tag, but keeps its children and text.

``.find_class(class_name)``:
    Returns a list of all the elements with the given CSS class name.
    Note that class names are space separated in HTML, so
    ``doc.find_class_name('highlight')`` will find an element like
    ``<div class="sidebar highlight">``.  Class names *are* case
    sensitive.

``.find_rel_links(rel)``:
    Returns a list of all the ``<a rel="{rel}">`` elements.  E.g.,
    ``doc.find_rel_links('tag')`` returns all the links `marked as
    tags <http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag>`_.

``.get_element_by_id(id, default=None)``:
    Return the element with the given ``id``, or the ``default`` if
    none is found.  If there are multiple elements with the same id
    (which there shouldn't be, but there often is), this returns only
    the first.

``.text_content()``:
    Returns the text content of the element, including the text
    content of its children, with no markup.

``.cssselect(expr)``:
    Select elements from this element and its children, using a CSS
    selector expression.  (Note that ``.xpath(expr)`` is also
    available as on all lxml elements.)

Running HTML doctests
=====================

One of the interesting modules in the ``lxml.html`` package deals with
doctests.  It can be hard to compare two HTML pages for equality, as
whitespace differences aren't meaningful and the structural formatting
can differ.  This is even more a problem in doctests, where output is
tested for equality and small differences in whitespace or the order
of attributes can let a test fail.  And given the verbosity of
tag-based languages, it may take more than a quick look to find the
actual differences in the doctest output.

Luckily, lxml provides the ``lxml.doctestcompare`` module that
supports relaxed comparison of XML and HTML pages and provides a
readable diff in the output when a test fails.  The HTML comparison is
most easily used by importing the ``usedoctest`` module in a doctest::

    >>> from lxml.html import usedoctest

Now, if you have a HTML document and want to compare it to an expected result
document in a doctest, you can do the following::

    >>> import lxml.html
    >>> html = lxml.html.HTML('''\
    ...    <html><body onload="" color="white">
    ...      <p>Hi  !</p>
    ...    </body></html>
    ... ''')

    >>> print lxml.html.tostring(html)
    <html><body onload="" color="white"><p>Hi !</p></body></html>

    >>> print lxml.html.tostring(html)
    <html> <body color="white" onload=""> <p>Hi    !</p> </body> </html>

    >>> print lxml.html.tostring(html)
    <html>
      <body color="white" onload="">
        <p>Hi !</p>
      </body>
    </html>

In documentation, you would likely prefer the pretty printed HTML output, as
it is the most readable.  However, the three documents are equivalent from the
point of view of an HTML tool, so the doctest will silently accept any of the
above.  This allows you to concentrate on readability in your doctests, even
if the real output is a straight ugly HTML one-liner.

Note that there is also an ``lxml.usedoctest`` module which you can
import for XML comparisons.  The HTML parser notably ignores
namespaces and some other XMLisms.


Creating HTML with the E-factory
================================

.. _`E-factory`: http://online.effbot.org/2006_11_01_archive.htm#et-builder

lxml.html comes with a predefined HTML vocabulary for the `E-factory`_,
originally written by Fredrik Lundh.  This allows you to quickly generate HTML
pages and fragments::

    >>> from lxml.html import builder as h

    >>> html = h.HTML(
    ...   h.HEAD(
    ...     h.LINK(rel="stylesheet", href="great.css", type="text/css"),
    ...     h.TITLE("Best Page Ever")
    ...   ),
    ...   h.BODY(
    ...     h.H1(h.CLASS("heading"), "Top News"),
    ...     h.P("World News only on this page", style="font-size: 200%"),
    ...     "Ah, and here's some more text, by the way.",
    ...     lxml.html.HTML("<p>... and this is a parsed fragment ...</p>")
    ...   )
    ... )

    >>> print lxml.html.tostring(html)
    <html>
      <head>
        <link href="great.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <title>Best Page Ever</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1 class="heading">Top News</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 200%">World News only on this page</p>
        Ah, and here's some more text, by the way.
        <p>... and this is a parsed fragment ...</p>
      </body>
    </html>

Note that you should use ``lxml.html.tostring`` and **not**
``lxml.tostring``.  ``lxml.tostring(doc)`` will return the XML
representation of the document, which is not valid HTML.  In
particular, things like ``<script src="..."></script>`` will be
serialized as ``<script src="..." />``, which completely confuses
browsers.


Working with links
==================

There are several methods on elements that allow you to see and modify
the links in a document.

``.iterlinks()``:
    This yields ``(element, attribute, link, pos)`` for every link in
    the document.  ``attribute`` may be None if the link is in the
    text (as will be the case with a ``<style>`` tag with
    ``@import``).  

    This finds any link in an ``action``, ``archive``, ``background``,
    ``cite``, ``classid``, ``codebase``, ``data``, ``href``,
    ``longdesc``, ``profile``, ``src``, ``usemap``, ``dynsrc``, or
    ``lowsrc`` attribute.  It also searches ``style`` attributes for
    ``url(link)``, and ``<style>`` tags for ``@import`` and ``url()``.

    This function does *not* pay attention to ``<base href>``.

``.resolve_base_href()``:
    This function will modify the document in-place to take account of
    ``<base href>`` if the document contains that tag.  In the process
    it will also remove that tag from the document.

``.make_links_absolute(base_href, resolve_base_href=True)``:
    This makes all links in the document absolute, assuming that
    ``base_href`` is the URL of the document.  So if you pass
    ``base_href="http://localhost/foo/bar.html"`` and there is a link
    to ``baz.html`` that will be rewritten as
    ``http://localhost/foo/baz.html``.

    If ``resolve_base_href`` is true, then any ``<base href>`` tag
    will be taken into account (just calling
    ``self.resolve_base_href()``).

``.rewrite_links(link_repl_func, resolve_base_href=True, base_href=None)``:
    This rewrites all the links in the document using your given link
    replacement function.  If you give a ``base_href`` value, all
    links will be passed in after they are joined with this URL.

    For each link ``link_repl_func(link)`` is called.  That function
    then returns the new link, or None to remove the attribute or tag
    that contains the link.  Note that all links will be passed in,
    including links like ``"#anchor"`` (which is purely internal), and
    things like ``"mailto:bob@example.com"`` (or ``javascript:...``).

    If you want access to the context of the link, you should use
    ``.iterlinks()`` instead.


Functions
---------

In addition to these methods, there are corresponding functions:

* ``iterlinks(html)``
* ``make_links_absolute(html, base_href, ...)``
* ``rewrite_links(html, link_repl_func, ...)``
* ``resolve_base_href(html)``

These functions will parse ``html`` if it is a string, then return the new
HTML as a string.  If you pass in a document, the document will be copied
(except for ``iterlinks()``), the method performed, and the new document
returned.


Cleaning up HTML
================

The module ``lxml.html.clean`` provides a ``Cleaner`` class for cleaning up
HTML pages.  It supports removing embedded or script content, special tags,
CSS style annotations and much more.

Say, you have an evil web page from an untrusted source that contains lots of
content that upsets browsers and tries to run evil code on the client side::

    >>> html = '''\
    ... <html>
    ...  <head>
    ...    <script type="text/javascript" src="evil-site"></script>
    ...    <link rel="alternate" type="text/rss" src="evil-rss">
    ...    <style>
    ...      body {background-image: url(javascript:do_evil)};
    ...      div {color: expression(evil)};
    ...    </style>
    ...  </head>
    ...  <body onload="evil_function()">
    ...    <!-- I am interpreted for EVIL! -->
    ...    <a href="javascript:evil_function()">a link</a>
    ...    <a href="#" onclick="evil_function()">another link</a>
    ...    <p onclick="evil_function()">a paragraph</p>
    ...    <div style="display: none">secret EVIL!</div>
    ...    <object> of EVIL! </object>
    ...    <iframe src="evil-site"></iframe>
    ...    <form action="evil-site">
    ...      Password: <input type="password" name="password">
    ...    </form>
    ...    <blink>annoying EVIL!</blink>
    ...    <a href="evil-site">spam spam SPAM!</a>
    ...    <image src="evil!">
    ...  </body>
    ... </html>'''

To remove the all suspicious content from this unparsed document, use the
``clean_html`` function::

    >>> from lxml.html.clean import clean_html
    
    >>> print clean_html(html)
    <html>
      <body>
        <div>
          <style>/* deleted */</style>
          <a href="">a link</a>
          <a href="#">another link</a>
          <p>a paragraph</p>
          <div>secret EVIL!</div>
          of EVIL!
          Password:
          annoying EVIL!
          <a href="evil-site">spam spam SPAM!</a>
          <img src="evil!">
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>

The ``Cleaner`` class supports several keyword arguments to control exactly
which content is removed::

    >>> from lxml.html.clean import Cleaner

    >>> cleaner = Cleaner(page_structure=False, links=False)
    >>> print cleaner.clean_html(html)
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="alternate" src="evil-rss" type="text/rss">
        <style>/* deleted */</style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <a href="">a link</a>
        <a href="#">another link</a>
        <p>a paragraph</p>
        <div>secret EVIL!</div>
        of EVIL!
        Password:
        annoying EVIL!
        <a href="evil-site">spam spam SPAM!</a>
        <img src="evil!">
      </body>
    </html>

    >>> cleaner = Cleaner(style=True, links=True, add_nofollow=True,
    ...                   page_structure=False, safe_attrs_only=False)
    
    >>> print cleaner.clean_html(html)
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        <a href="">a link</a>
        <a href="#">another link</a>
        <p>a paragraph</p>
        <div>secret EVIL!</div>
        of EVIL!
        Password:
        annoying EVIL!
        <a href="evil-site" rel="nofollow">spam spam SPAM!</a>
        <img src="evil!">
      </body>
    </html>

See the docstring of ``Cleaner`` for the details of what can be
cleaned.


autolink
--------

In addition to cleaning up malicious HTML, ``lxml.html.clean``
contains functions to do other things to your HTML.  This includes
autolinking:

  ``autolink(doc, ...)`` and ``autolink_html(html, ...)``

This finds anything that looks like a link (e.g.,
``http://example.com``) in the *text* of an HTML document, and
turns it into an anchor.  It avoids making bad links.

Links in the elements ``<textarea>``, ``<pre>``, ``<code>``,
anything in the head of the document.  You can pass in a list of
elements to avoid in ``avoid_elements=['textarea', ...]``.

Links to some hosts can be avoided.  By default links to
``localhost*``, ``example.*`` and ``127.0.0.1`` are not
autolinked.  Pass in ``avoid_hosts=[list_of_regexes]`` to control
this.

Elements with the ``nolink`` CSS class are not autolinked.  Pass
in ``avoid_classes=['code', ...]`` to control this.

The ``autolink_html()`` version of the function parses the HTML
string first, and returns a string.


wordwrap
--------

You can also wrap long words in your html:

  ``word_break(doc, max_width=40, ...)`` and ``word_break_html(html, ...)``

This finds any long words in the text of the document and inserts
``&#8203;`` in the document (which is the Unicode zero-width space).

This avoids the elements ``<pre>``, ``<textarea>``, and ``<code>``.
You can control this with ``avoid_elements=['textarea', ...]``.

It also avoids elements with the CSS class ``nobreak``.  You can
control this with ``avoid_classes=['code', ...]``.

Lastly you can control the character that is inserted with
``break_character=u'\u200b'``.  However, you cannot insert markup,
only text.

``word_break_html(html)`` parses the HTML document and returns a
string.

Examples
========

Microformat Example
-------------------

This example parses the `hCard <http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard>`_
microformat.

First we get the page::

    >>> import urllib
    >>> from lxml.html import HTML
    >>> url = 'http://microformats.org/'
    >>> content = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
    >>> doc = HTML(content)
    >>> doc.make_links_absolute(url)

Then we create some objects to put the information in:

    >>> class Card(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, **kw):
    ...         for name, value in kw:
    ...             setattr(self, name, value)
    >>> class Phone(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, phone, types=()):
    ...         self.phone, self.types = phone, types

And some generally handy functions for microformats:

    >>> def get_text(el, class_name):
    ...     els = el.find_class(class_name)
    ...     if els:
    ...         return els[0].text_content()
    ...     else:
    ...         return ''
    >>> def get_value(el):
    ...     return get_text(el, 'value') or el.text_content()
    >>> def get_all_texts(el, class_name):
    ...     return [e.text_content() for e in els.find_class(class_name)]
    >>> def parse_addresses(el):
    ...     # Ideally this would parse street, etc.
    ...     return el.find_class('adr')

Then the parsing:

    >>> for el in doc.find_class('hcard'):
    ...     card = Card()
    ...     card.el = el
    ...     card.fn = get_text(el, 'fn')
    ...     card.tels = []
    ...     for tel_el in card.find_class('tel'):
    ...         card.tels.append(Phone(get_value(tel_el),
    ...                                get_all_texts(tel_el, 'type')))
    ...     card.addresses = parse_addresses(el)
