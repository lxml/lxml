Introduction
------------

lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2_ and libxslt_ libraries.  It is
unique in that it combines the speed and feature completeness of these
libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but
superior to the well-known ElementTree_ API.  See the introduction_ for more
information about background and goals.  Some common questions are answered in
the FAQ_.

Documentation
-------------

* ElementTree:

  * `ElementTree API`_

  * compatibility_ and differences of lxml.etree

  * `benchmark results`_

* lxml.etree:

  * the `lxml.etree Tutorial`_

  * `lxml.etree specific API`_ documentation

  * the `generated API documentation`_ as a reference

  * parsing_ and validating_ XML

  * `XPath and XSLT`_ support

  * Python `extension functions`_ for XPath and XSLT

  * `custom element classes`_ for custom XML APIs

  * a `SAX compliant API`_ for interfacing with other XML tools

  * a `C-level API`_ for interfacing with external C/Pyrex modules

* lxml.objectify:

  * `lxml.objectify`_ API documentation

  * a brief comparison of `objectify and etree`_

lxml.etree follows the ElementTree_ API as much as possible, building it on
top of the native libxml2 tree.  If you are new to ElementTree, start with the
`lxml.etree Tutorial`_.  See also the ElementTree compatibility_ overview and
the `benchmark results`_ comparing lxml to the original ElementTree_ and
cElementTree_ implementations.

Right after the `lxml.etree Tutorial`_ and the ElementTree_ documentation, the
most important place to look is the `lxml.etree specific API`_ documentation.
It describes how lxml extends the ElementTree API to expose libxml2 and
libxslt specific functionality, such as XPath_, `Relax NG`_, `XML Schema`_,
`XSLT`_, and `c14n`_.  Python code can be called from XPath expressions and
XSLT stylesheets through the use of `extension functions`_.  lxml also offers
a `SAX compliant API`_, that works with the SAX support in the standard
library.

There is a separate module `lxml.objectify`_ that implements a data-binding
API on top of lxml.etree.  See the `objectify and etree`_ FAQ entry for a
comparison.

In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features a sophisticated API for
`custom element classes`_.  This is a simple way to write arbitrary XML driven
APIs on top of lxml.  As of version 1.1, lxml.etree has a new `C-level API`_
that can be used to efficiently extend lxml.etree in external C modules,
including custom element class support.

Download
--------

The best way to download lxml is to visit `lxml at the Python Package
Index`_ (PyPI).  It has the source that compiles on various platforms.
The source distribution is signed with `this key`_.  Binary builds for
MS Windows usually become available through PyPI a few days after a
source release.  If you can't wait, consider trying a less recent
version first.

.. _`lxml at the Python Package Index`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/
.. _`this key`: pubkey.asc

The latest version is `lxml 2.0.1`_, released 2008-02-13
(`changes for 2.0.1`_).  `Older versions`_ are listed below.

.. _`Older versions`: #old-versions

Please take a look at the `installation instructions`_!

.. _`installation instructions`: installation.html

It's also possible to check out the latest development version of lxml
from svn directly, using a command like this::

  svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk lxml

You can also `browse it through the web`_.  Please read `how to build lxml
from source`_ first.  The `latest CHANGES`_ of the developer version are also
accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been fixed or a
feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk version.

Bug tracker
-----------

lxml uses the `launchpad bug tracker`_.  If you are sure you found a bug in
lxml, please file a bug report there.  If you are not sure whether some
unexpected behaviour of lxml is a bug or not, please ask on the `mailing
list`_ first.  Do not forget to search the archive (e.g. with Gmane_)!

The lxml library is shipped under a `BSD license`_. libxml2 and libxslt2
itself are shipped under the `MIT license`_. There should therefore be no
obstacle to using lxml in your codebase.
