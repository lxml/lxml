General Questions
=================

Is there a tutorial?
--------------------

There is a `tutorial for ElementTree`_ which also works for ``lxml.etree``.
The `API documentation`_ also contains many examples for ``lxml.etree``.  To
learn using ``lxml.objectify``, read the `objectify documentation`_.

.. _`tutorial for ElementTree`: http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm
.. _`API documentation`:        api.html
.. _`objectify documentation`:  objectify.html


Where can I find more documentation about lxml?
-----------------------------------------------

There is a lot of documentation as lxml implements the well-known `ElementTree
API`_ and tries to follow its documentation as closely as possible.  There are
a couple of issues where lxml cannot keep up compatibility.  They are
described in the compatibility_ documentation.  The lxml specific extensions
to the API are described by individual files in the ``doc`` directory of the
distribution and on `the web page`_.

.. _`ElementTree API`: http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm
.. _`the web page`:    http://codespeak.net/lxml/#documentation


What is the difference between lxml.etree and lxml.objectify?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The two modules provide different ways of handling XML.  However, objectify
builds on top of lxml.etree and therefore inherits most of its capabilities
and a large portion of its API.

* lxml.etree is a generic API for XML and HTML handling.  It aims for
  ElementTree compatibility_ and supports the entire XML infoset.  It is well
  suited for both mixed content and data centric XML.  Its generality makes it
  the best choice for most applications.

* lxml.objectify is a specialized API for XML data handling in a Python object
  syntax.  It provides a very natural way to deal with data fields stored in a
  structurally well defined XML format.  Data is automatically converted to
  Python data types and can be manipulated with normal Python operators.  Look
  at the examples in the `objectify documentation`_ to see what it feels like
  to use it.

  Objectify is not well suited for mixed contents or HTML documents.  As it is
  built on top of lxml.etree, however, it inherits the normal support for
  XPath, XSLT or validation.


Why is my application so slow?
------------------------------

lxml.etree is a very fast library for processing XML.  There are, however, `a
few caveats`_ involved in the mapping of the powerful libxml2 library to the
simple and convenient ElementTree API.  Not all operations are as fast as the
simplicity of the API might suggest.  The `benchmark page`_ has a comparison
to other ElementTree implementations and a number of tips for performance
tweaking.  As with any Python application, the rule of thumb is: the more of
your processing runs in C, the faster your application gets.

.. _`a few caveats`:  performance.html#the-elementtree-api
.. _`benchmark page`: performance.html


Why do I get errors about missing UCS4 symbols when installing lxml?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Most likely, you use a Python installation that was configured for internal
use of UCS2 unicode, meaning 16-bit unicode.  The lxml egg distributions are
generally compiled on platforms that use UCS4, a 32-bit unicode encoding, as
this is used on the majority of platforms.  Sadly, both are not compatible, so
the eggs can only support the one they were compiled with.

This means that you have to compile lxml from sources for your system.  Note
that you do not need Pyrex for this, the lxml source distribution is directly
compilable on both platform types.  See the `build instructions`_ on how to do
this.

.. _`build instructions`: build.html


Bugs
====

My application crashes! Why does lxml.etree do that?
----------------------------------------------------

One of the goals of lxml is "no segfaults", so if there is no clear warning in
the documentation that you were doing something potentially harmful, you have
found a bug and we would like to hear about it.  Please report this bug to the
mailing list.  See the next section on how to do that.


I think I have found a bug in lxml. What should I do?
-----------------------------------------------------

a) First, you should look at the `current developer changelog`_ to see if this
   is a known problem that has already been fixed in the SVN trunk.

   .. _`current developer changelog`: http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk/CHANGES.txt

b) If you are using threads, please see the following section to check if
   you touch on one of the potential pitfalls.

c) Otherwise, we would really like to hear about it.  Please report it to the
   `mailing list`_ so that we can fix it.  It is very helpful in this case if
   you can come up with a short code snippet that demonstrates your problem.
   Please also report the version of lxml, libxml2 and libxslt that you are
   using by calling this::

       from lxml import etree
       print "lxml.etree:       ", etree.LXML_VERSION
       print "libxml used:      ", etree.LIBXML_VERSION
       print "libxml compiled:  ", etree.LIBXML_COMPILED_VERSION
       print "libxslt used:     ", etree.LIBXSLT_VERSION
       print "libxslt compiled: ", etree.LIBXSLT_COMPILED_VERSION

   .. _`mailing list`: http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/lxml-dev


Threading
=========

Can I use threads to concurrently access the lxml API?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes, although not carelessly.

lxml frees the GIL (Python's global interpreter lock) internally when parsing
from disk and memory, as long as you use either the default parser (which is
replicated for each thread) or create a parser for each thread yourself.  lxml
also allows concurrency during validation (RelaxNG and XMLSchema) and XSL
transformation.  You can share RelaxNG, XMLSchema and XSLT objects between
threads.  While you can also share parsers between threads, this will
serialize the access to each of them, so it is better to copy() parsers or to
use the default parser.  Note that access to the XML() and HTML() functions is
always serialized.  If you need to parse concurrently from strings, use
``parse()`` with ``StringIO``.

Due to the way libxslt handles threading, concurrent access to stylesheets is
currently only possible if it was parsed in the main thread.  Parsing and
using a stylesheet inside one thread also works.

Warning: You should generally avoid modifying trees in other threads than the
one it was generated in.  Although this should work in many cases, there are
certain scenarios where the termination of a thread that parsed a tree can
crash the application if subtrees of this tree were moved to other documents.
You should be on the safe side when passing trees between threads if you
either

a) do not modify these trees and do not move their elements to other trees, or
b) do not terminate threads while the trees they parsed are still in use
   (e.g. by using a fixed size thread-pool or long-running threads in
   processing chains)


Does my program run faster if I use threads?
--------------------------------------------

Depends.  The best way to answer this is timing and profiling.

The global interpreter lock (GIL) in Python serializes access to the
interpreter, so if the majority of your processing is done in Python code
(traversing trees, modifying elements, etc.), your gain will be close to 0.
The more of your XML processing moves into lxml, however, the higher your
gain.  If your application is bound by XML parsing and serialisation, or by
complex XSLTs, your speedup on multi-processor machines can be substantial.

See the question above to learn which operations free the GIL to support
multi-threading.


Parsing and Serialisation
=========================

Why doesn't the ``pretty_print`` option reformat my XML output?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty printing (or formatting) an XML document means adding white space to
the content.  These modifications are harmless if they only impact elements in
the document that do not carry (text) data.  They corrupt your data if they
impact elements that contain data.  If lxml cannot distinguish between
whitespace and data, it will not alter your data.  Whitespace is therefore
only added between nodes that do not contain data.  This is always the case
for trees constructed element-by-element, so no problems should be expected
here.  For parsed trees, a good way to assure that no conflicting whitespace
is left in the tree is the ``remove_blank_text`` option::

   >>> parser = etree.XMLParser(remove_blank_text=True)
   >>> tree = etree.parse(file, parser)

This will allow the parser to drop blank text nodes when constructing the
tree.  If you now call a serialization function to pretty print this tree,
lxml can add fresh whitespace to the XML tree to indent it.


Why can't lxml parse my XML from unicode strings?
-------------------------------------------------

lxml can read Python unicode strings and even tries to support them if libxml2
does not.  However, if the unicode string declares an XML encoding internally
(``<?xml encoding="..."?>``), parsing is bound to fail, as this encoding is
most likely not the real encoding used in Python unicode.  The same is true
for HTML unicode strings that contain charset meta tags, although the problems
may be more subtle here.  The libxml2 HTML parser may not be able to parse the
meta tags in broken HTML and simply ignore them, so even if parsing succeeds,
later handling may still fail with character encoding errors.

Note that Python uses different encodings for unicode on different platforms,
so even specifying the real internal unicode encoding is not portable between
Python interpreters.  Don't do it.

Python unicode strings with XML data or HTML data that carry encoding
information are broken.  lxml will not parse them.  You must provide parsable
data in a valid encoding.


What is the difference between str(xslt(doc)) and xslt(doc).write() ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The str() implementation of the XSLTResultTree class (a subclass of the
ElementTree class) knows about the output method chosen in the stylesheet
(xsl:output), write() doesn't.  If you call write(), the result will be a
normal XML tree serialization in the requested encoding.  Calling this method
may also fail for XSLT results that are not XML trees (e.g. string results).

If you call str(), it will return the serialized result as specified by the
XSL transform.  This correctly serializes string results to encoded Python
strings and honours ``xsl:output`` options like ``indent``.  This almost
certainly does what you want, so you should only use ``write()`` if you are
sure that the XSLT result is an XML tree and you want to override the encoding
and indentation options requested by the stylesheet.


Why can't I just delete parents or clear the root node in iterparse()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``iterparse()`` implementation is based on the libxml2 parser.  It
requires the tree to be intact to finish parsing.  If you delete or modify
parents of the current node, chances are you modify the structure in a way
that breaks the parser.  Normally, this will result in a segfault.  Please
refer to the `iterparse section`_ of the lxml API documentation to find out
what you can do and what you can't do.

.. _`iterparse section`: api.html#iterparse-and-iterwalk


XPath and Document Traversal
============================

What are the ``findall()`` and ``xpath()`` methods on Element(Tree)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

``findall()`` is part of the original `ElementTree API`_.  It supports a
`simple subset of the XPath language`_, without predicates, conditions and
other advanced features.  It is very handy for finding specific tags in a
tree.  Another important difference is namespace handling, which uses the
``{namespace}tagname`` notation.  This is not supported by XPath.  The
findall, find and findtext methods are compatible with other ElementTree
implementations and allow writing portable code that runs on ElementTree,
cElementTree and lxml.etree.

``xpath()``, on the other hand, supports the complete power of the XPath
language, including predicates, XPath functions and Python extension
functions.  The syntax is defined by the `XPath specification`_.  If you need
the expressiveness and selectivity of XPath, the ``xpath()`` method, the
``XPath`` class and the ``XPathEvaluator`` are the best choice_.

.. _`simple subset of the XPath language`: http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm
.. _`XPath specification`:                 http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath
.. _choice:                                performance.html#xpath


Why doesn't ``findall()`` support full XPath expressions?
---------------------------------------------------------

It was decided that it is more important to keep compatibility with
ElementTree_ to simplify code migration between the libraries.  The main
difference compared to XPath is the ``{namespace}tagname`` notation used in
``findall()``, which is not valid XPath.

ElementTree and lxml.etree use the same implementation, which assures 100%
compatibility.  Note that ``findall()`` is `so fast`_ in lxml that a native
implementation would not bring any performance benefits.

.. _`so fast`: performance.html#tree-traversal


How can I find out which namespace prefixes are used in a document?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You can traverse the document (``getiterator()``) and collect the prefix
attributes from all Elements into a set.  However, it is unlikely that you
really want to do that.  You do not need these prefixes, honestly.  You only
need the namespace URIs.  All namespace comparisons use these, so feel free to
make up your own prefixes when you use XPath expressions or extension
functions.

The only place where you might consider specifying prefixes is the
serialization of Elements that were created through the API.  Here, you can
specify a prefix mapping through the ``nsmap`` argument when creating the root
Element.  Its children will then inherit this prefix for serialization.


How can I specify a default namespace for XPath expressions?
------------------------------------------------------------

You can't.  In XPath, there is no such thing as a default namespace.  Just use
an arbitrary prefix and let the namespace dictionary of the XPath evaluators
map it to your namespace.  See also the question above.
