XPath and XSLT with lxml
========================

lxml supports both XPath and XSLT through libxml2 and libxslt in a standards
compliant way.

XPath
-----

lxml.etree supports the simple path syntax of the ``findall()`` etc.  methods
on ElementTree and Element, as known from the original ElementTree library.
As an extension, these classes also provide an ``xpath()`` method that
supports expressions in the complete XPath syntax.

There are also specialized XPath evaluator classes that are more efficient for
frequent evaluation: ``XPath`` and ``XPathEvaluator``.  See the `performance
comparison`_ to learn when to use which.  Their semantics when used on
Elements and ElementTrees are the same as for the ``xpath()`` method described
here.

.. _`performance comparison`: performance.html#xpath

For ElementTree, the xpath method performs a global XPath query against the
document (if absolute) or against the root node (if relative)::

  >>> f = StringIO('<foo><bar></bar></foo>')
  >>> tree = etree.parse(f)

  >>> r = tree.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> len(r)
  1
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> r = tree.xpath('bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

When ``xpath()`` is used on an element, the XPath expression is evaluated
against the element (if relative) or against the root tree (if absolute)::

  >>> root = tree.getroot()
  >>> r = root.xpath('bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> bar = root[0]
  >>> r = bar.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> tree = bar.getroottree()
  >>> r = tree.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

Optionally, you can provide a ``namespaces`` keyword argument, which should be
a dictionary mapping the namespace prefixes used in the XPath expression to
namespace URIs::

  >>> f = StringIO('''\
  ... <a:foo xmlns:a="http://codespeak.net/ns/test1" 
  ...       xmlns:b="http://codespeak.net/ns/test2">
  ...    <b:bar>Text</b:bar>
  ... </a:foo>
  ... ''')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> r = doc.xpath('/t:foo/b:bar', {'t': 'http://codespeak.net/ns/test1', 
  ...                                'b': 'http://codespeak.net/ns/test2'})
  >>> len(r)
  1
  >>> r[0].tag
  '{http://codespeak.net/ns/test2}bar'
  >>> r[0].text
  'Text'

There is also an optional ``extensions`` argument which is used to define
`extension functions`_ in Python that are local to this evaluation.

.. _`extension functions`: extensions.html

The return values of XPath evaluations vary, depending on the XPath expression
used:

* True or False, when the XPath expression has a boolean result

* a float, when the XPath expression has a numeric result (integer or float)

* a (unicode) string, when the XPath expression has a string result.

* a list of items, when the XPath expression has a list as result.  The items
  may include elements, strings and tuples.  Text nodes and attributes in the
  result are returned as strings (the text node content or attribute value).
  Comments are also returned as strings, enclosed by the usual ``<!--`` and
  ``-->`` markers.  Namespace declarations are returned as tuples of strings:
  ``(prefix, URI)``.

A related convenience method of ElementTree objects is ``getpath(element)``,
which returns a structural, absolute XPath expression to find that element::

  >>> a  = etree.Element("a")
  >>> b  = etree.SubElement(a, "b")
  >>> c  = etree.SubElement(a, "c")
  >>> d1 = etree.SubElement(c, "d")
  >>> d2 = etree.SubElement(c, "d")

  >>> tree = etree.ElementTree(c)
  >>> print tree.getpath(d2)
  /c/d[2]
  >>> tree.xpath(tree.getpath(d2)) == [d2]
  True


XSLT
----

lxml.etree introduces a new class, lxml.etree.XSLT. The class can be
given an ElementTree object to construct an XSLT transformer::

  >>> f = StringIO('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="/a/b/text()" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> xslt_doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_doc)

You can then run the transformation on an ElementTree document by simply
calling it, and this results in another ElementTree object::

  >>> f = StringIO('<a><b>Text</b></a>')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> result = transform(doc)

The result object can be accessed like a normal ElementTree document::

  >>> result.getroot().text
  'Text'

but, as opposed to normal ElementTree objects, can also be turned into an (XML
or text) string by applying the str() function::

  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'

The result is always a plain string, encoded as requested by the
``xsl:output`` element in the stylesheet.  If you want a Python unicode string
instead, you should set this encoding to ``UTF-8`` (unless the `ASCII` default
is sufficient).  This allows you to call the builtin ``unicode()`` function on
the result::

  >>> unicode(result)
  u'<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'

You can use other encodings at the cost of multiple recoding.  Encodings that
are not supported by Python will result in an error::

  >>> xslt_tree = etree.XML('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:output encoding="UCS4"/>
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="/a/b/text()" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)

  >>> result = transform(doc)
  >>> unicode(result)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
  LookupError: unknown encoding: UCS4

It is possible to pass parameters, in the form of XPath expressions, to the
XSLT template::

  >>> xslt_tree = etree.XML('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="$a" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)
  >>> f = StringIO('<a><b>Text</b></a>')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)

The parameters are passed as keyword parameters to the transform call. First
let's try passing in a simple string expression::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="'A'")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>A</foo>\n'

Let's try a non-string XPath expression now::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="/a/b/text()")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'

There's also a convenience method on the tree object for doing XSL
transformations.  This is less efficient if you want to apply the same XSL
transformation to multiple documents, but is shorter to write for one-shot
operations, as you do not have to instantiate a stylesheet yourself::

  >>> result = doc.xslt(xslt_tree, a="'A'")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>A</foo>\n'

By default, XSLT supports all extension functions from libxslt and libexslt as
well as Python regular expressions through EXSLT.  Note that some extensions
enable style sheets to read and write files on the local file system.  See the
`document loader documentation`_ on how to deal with this.

.. _`document loader documentation`: resolvers.html

If you want to know how your stylesheet performed, pass the ``profile_run``
keyword to the transform::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="/a/b/text()", profile_run=True)
  >>> profile = result.xslt_profile

The value of the ``xslt_profile`` property is an ElementTree with profiling
data about each template, similar to the following::

  <profile>
    <template rank="1" match="/" name="" mode="" calls="1" time="1" average="1"/>
  </profile>

Note that this is a read-only document.  You must not move any of its elements
to other documents.  Please deep-copy the document if you need to modify it.
If you want to free it from memory, just do::

  >>> del result.xslt_profile
