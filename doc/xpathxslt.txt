XPath
=====

lxml.etree supports the simple path syntax of the `find, findall and
findtext`_ methods on ElementTree and Element, as known from the original
ElementTree library (ElementPath_).  As an lxml specific extension, these
classes also provide an ``xpath()`` method that supports expressions in the
complete XPath syntax, as well as `custom extension functions`_.

.. _`find,  findall and findtext`: http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm#searching-for-subelements
.. _`custom extension functions`: extensions.html

There are also specialized XPath evaluator classes that are more efficient for
frequent evaluation: ``XPath`` and ``XPathEvaluator``.  See the `performance
comparison`_ to learn when to use which.  Their semantics when used on
Elements and ElementTrees are the same as for the ``xpath()`` method described
here.

.. _`performance comparison`: performance.html#xpath


The ``xpath()`` method
----------------------

For ElementTree, the xpath method performs a global XPath query against the
document (if absolute) or against the root node (if relative)::

  >>> f = StringIO('<foo><bar></bar></foo>')
  >>> tree = etree.parse(f)

  >>> r = tree.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> len(r)
  1
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> r = tree.xpath('bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

When ``xpath()`` is used on an Element, the XPath expression is evaluated
against the element (if relative) or against the root tree (if absolute)::

  >>> root = tree.getroot()
  >>> r = root.xpath('bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> bar = root[0]
  >>> r = bar.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

  >>> tree = bar.getroottree()
  >>> r = tree.xpath('/foo/bar')
  >>> r[0].tag
  'bar'

The ``xpath()`` method has support for XPath variables::

  >>> expr = "//*[local-name() = $name]"

  >>> print root.xpath(expr, name = "foo")[0].tag
  foo

  >>> print root.xpath(expr, name = "bar")[0].tag
  bar

  >>> print root.xpath("$text", text = "Hello World!")
  Hello World!

Optionally, you can provide a ``namespaces`` keyword argument, which should be
a dictionary mapping the namespace prefixes used in the XPath expression to
namespace URIs::

  >>> f = StringIO('''\
  ... <a:foo xmlns:a="http://codespeak.net/ns/test1" 
  ...        xmlns:b="http://codespeak.net/ns/test2">
  ...    <b:bar>Text</b:bar>
  ... </a:foo>
  ... ''')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)

  >>> r = doc.xpath('/t:foo/b:bar',
  ...               namespaces={'t': 'http://codespeak.net/ns/test1', 
  ...                           'b': 'http://codespeak.net/ns/test2'})
  >>> len(r)
  1
  >>> r[0].tag
  '{http://codespeak.net/ns/test2}bar'
  >>> r[0].text
  'Text'

There is also an optional ``extensions`` argument which is used to define
`custom extension functions`_ in Python that are local to this evaluation.


XPath return values
-------------------

The return values of XPath evaluations vary, depending on the XPath expression
used:

* True or False, when the XPath expression has a boolean result

* a float, when the XPath expression has a numeric result (integer or float)

* a 'smart' string (as described below), when the XPath expression has
  a string result.

* a list of items, when the XPath expression has a list as result.
  The items may include Elements (also comments and processing
  instructions), strings and tuples.  Text nodes and attributes in the
  result are returned as 'smart' string values.  Namespace
  declarations are returned as tuples of strings: ``(prefix, URI)``.

XPath string results are 'smart' in that they provide a
``getparent()`` method that knows their origin:

* for attribute values, ``result.getparent()`` returns the Element
  that carries them.  An example is ``//foo/@attribute``, where the
  parent would be a ``foo`` Element.

* for the ``text()`` function (as in ``//text()``), it returns the
  Element that contains the text or tail that was returned.

You can distinguish between different text origins with the boolean
properties ``is_text``, ``is_tail`` and ``is_attribute``.

Note that ``getparent()`` may not always return an Element.  For
example, the XPath functions ``string()`` and ``concat()`` will
construct strings that do not have an origin.  For them,
``getparent()`` will return None.


Generating XPath expressions
----------------------------

ElementTree objects have a method ``getpath(element)``, which returns a
structural, absolute XPath expression to find that element::

  >>> a  = etree.Element("a")
  >>> b  = etree.SubElement(a, "b")
  >>> c  = etree.SubElement(a, "c")
  >>> d1 = etree.SubElement(c, "d")
  >>> d2 = etree.SubElement(c, "d")

  >>> tree = etree.ElementTree(c)
  >>> print tree.getpath(d2)
  /c/d[2]
  >>> tree.xpath(tree.getpath(d2)) == [d2]
  True


The ``XPath`` class
-------------------

The ``XPath`` class compiles an XPath expression into a callable function::

  >>> root = etree.XML("<root><a><b/></a><b/></root>")

  >>> find = etree.XPath("//b")
  >>> print find(root)[0].tag
  b

The compilation takes as much time as in the ``xpath()`` method, but it is
done only once per class instantiation.  This makes it especially efficient
for repeated evaluation of the same XPath expression.

Just like the ``xpath()`` method, the ``XPath`` class supports XPath
variables::

  >>> count_elements = etree.XPath("count(//*[local-name() = $name])")

  >>> print count_elements(root, name = "a")
  1.0
  >>> print count_elements(root, name = "b")
  2.0

This supports very efficient evaluation of modified versions of an XPath
expression, as compilation is still only required once.

Prefix-to-namespace mappings can be passed as second parameter::

  >>> root = etree.XML("<root xmlns='NS'><a><b/></a><b/></root>")

  >>> find = etree.XPath("//n:b", namespaces={'n':'NS'})
  >>> print find(root)[0].tag
  {NS}b

By default, ``XPath`` supports regular expressions in the EXSLT_ namespace::

  >>> regexpNS = "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"
  >>> find = etree.XPath("//*[re:test(., '^abc$', 'i')]",
  ...                    namespaces={'re':regexpNS})

  >>> root = etree.XML("<root><a>aB</a><b>aBc</b></root>")
  >>> print find(root)[0].text
  aBc

.. _EXSLT: http://www.exslt.org/

You can disable this with the boolean keyword argument ``regexp`` which
defaults to True.


The ``XPathEvaluator`` classes
------------------------------

lxml.etree provides two other efficient XPath evaluators that work on
ElementTrees or Elements respectively: ``XPathDocumentEvaluator`` and
``XPathElementEvaluator``.  They are automatically selected if you use the
XPathEvaluator helper for instantiation::

  >>> root = etree.XML("<root><a><b/></a><b/></root>")
  >>> xpatheval = etree.XPathEvaluator(root)

  >>> print isinstance(xpatheval, etree.XPathElementEvaluator)
  True

  >>> print xpatheval("//b")[0].tag
  b

This class provides efficient support for evaluating different XPath
expressions on the same Element or ElementTree.


``ETXPath``
-----------

ElementTree supports a language named ElementPath_ in its ``find*()`` methods.
One of the main differences between XPath and ElementPath is that the XPath
language requires an indirection through prefixes for namespace support,
whereas ElementTree uses the Clark notation (``{ns}name``) to avoid prefixes
completely.  The other major difference regards the capabilities of both path
languages.  Where XPath supports various sophisticated ways of restricting the
result set through functions and boolean expressions, ElementPath only
supports pure path traversal without nesting or further conditions.  So, while
the ElementPath syntax is self-contained and therefore easier to write and
handle, XPath is much more powerful and expressive.

lxml.etree bridges this gap through the class ``ETXPath``, which accepts XPath
expressions with namespaces in Clark notation.  It is identical to the
``XPath`` class, except for the namespace notation.  Normally, you would
write::

  >>> root = etree.XML("<root xmlns='ns'><a><b/></a><b/></root>")

  >>> find = etree.XPath("//p:b", namespaces={'p' : 'ns'})
  >>> print find(root)[0].tag
  {ns}b

``ETXPath`` allows you to change this to::

  >>> find = etree.ETXPath("//{ns}b")
  >>> print find(root)[0].tag
  {ns}b


Error handling
--------------

lxml.etree raises exceptions when errors occur while parsing or evaluating an
XPath expression::

  >>> find = etree.XPath("\\")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathSyntaxError: Invalid expression

lxml will also try to give you a hint what went wrong, so if you pass a more
complex expression, you may get a somewhat more specific error::

  >>> find = etree.XPath("//*[1.1.1]")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathSyntaxError: Invalid predicate

During evaluation, lxml will emit an XPathEvalError on errors::

  >>> find = etree.XPath("//ns:a")
  >>> find(root)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathEvalError: Undefined namespace prefix

This works for the ``XPath`` class, however, the other evaluators (including
the ``xpath()`` method) are one-shot operations that do parsing and evaluation
in one step.  They therefore raise evaluation exceptions in all cases::

  >>> root = etree.Element("test")
  >>> find = root.xpath("//*[1.1.1]")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathEvalError: Invalid predicate

  >>> find = root.xpath("//ns:a")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathEvalError: Undefined namespace prefix

  >>> find = root.xpath("\\")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  XPathEvalError: Invalid expression

Note that lxml versions before 1.3 always raised an ``XPathSyntaxError`` for
all errors, including evaluation errors.  The best way to support older
versions is to except on the superclass ``XPathError``.


XSLT
====

lxml.etree introduces a new class, lxml.etree.XSLT. The class can be
given an ElementTree object to construct an XSLT transformer::

  >>> f = StringIO('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="/a/b/text()" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> xslt_doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_doc)

You can then run the transformation on an ElementTree document by simply
calling it, and this results in another ElementTree object::

  >>> f = StringIO('<a><b>Text</b></a>')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> result_tree = transform(doc)

By default, XSLT supports all extension functions from libxslt and libexslt as
well as Python regular expressions through the `EXSLT regexp functions`_.
Also see the documentation on `custom extension functions`_ and `document
resolvers`_.  There is a separate section on `controlling access`_ to external
documents and resources.

.. _`EXSLT regexp functions`: http://www.exslt.org/regexp/
.. _`document resolvers`: resolvers.html
.. _`controlling access`: resolvers.html#i-o-access-control-in-xslt


XSLT result objects
-------------------

The result of an XSL transformation can be accessed like a normal ElementTree
document::

  >>> f = StringIO('<a><b>Text</b></a>')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)
  >>> result = transform(doc)

  >>> result.getroot().text
  'Text'

but, as opposed to normal ElementTree objects, can also be turned into an (XML
or text) string by applying the str() function::

  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'

The result is always a plain string, encoded as requested by the
``xsl:output`` element in the stylesheet.  If you want a Python unicode string
instead, you should set this encoding to ``UTF-8`` (unless the `ASCII` default
is sufficient).  This allows you to call the builtin ``unicode()`` function on
the result::

  >>> unicode(result)
  u'<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'

You can use other encodings at the cost of multiple recoding.  Encodings that
are not supported by Python will result in an error::

  >>> xslt_tree = etree.XML('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:output encoding="UCS4"/>
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="/a/b/text()" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)

  >>> result = transform(doc)
  >>> unicode(result)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
  LookupError: unknown encoding: UCS4


Stylesheet parameters
---------------------

It is possible to pass parameters, in the form of XPath expressions, to the
XSLT template::

  >>> xslt_tree = etree.XML('''\
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><xsl:value-of select="$a" /></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)
  >>> f = StringIO('<a><b>Text</b></a>')
  >>> doc = etree.parse(f)

The parameters are passed as keyword parameters to the transform call. First
let's try passing in a simple string expression::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="'A'")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>A</foo>\n'

Let's try a non-string XPath expression now::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="/a/b/text()")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>Text</foo>\n'


Extension elements
------------------

Just like `custom extension functions`_, lxml supports custom
extension *elements* in XSLT.  This means, you can write XSLT code
like this::

  <xsl:template match="*">
      <my:python-extension>
          <some-content />
      </my:python-extension>
  </xsl:template>

And then you can implement the element in Python like this::

  >>> class MyExtElement(etree.XSLTExtension):
  ...     def execute(self, context, self_node, input_node, output_parent):
  ...         print "Hello from XSLT!"
  ...         output_parent.text = "I did it!"
  ...         # just copy own content input to output
  ...         output_parent.extend( list(self_node) )

The arguments passed to this function are

context
    The opaque evaluation context.  You need this when calling back
    into the XSLT processor.

self_node
    A read-only Element object that represents the extension element
    in the stylesheet.

input_node
    The current context Element in the input document (also read-only).

output_parent
    The current insertion point in the output document.  You can
    append elements or set the text value (not the tail).  Apart from
    that, the Element is read-only.

In XSLT, extension elements can be used like any other XSLT element,
except that they must be declared as extensions using the standard
XSLT ``extension-element-prefixes`` option::

  >>> xslt_ext_tree = etree.XML('''
  ... <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  ...     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  ...     xmlns:my="testns"
  ...     extension-element-prefixes="my">
  ...     <xsl:template match="/">
  ...         <foo><my:ext><child>XYZ</child></my:ext></foo>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ...     <xsl:template match="child">
  ...         <CHILD>--xyz--</CHILD>
  ...     </xsl:template>
  ... </xsl:stylesheet>''')

To register the extension, add its name and namespace to the extension
mapping of the XSLT object::

  >>> my_extension = MyExtElement()
  >>> extensions = { ('testns', 'ext') : my_extension }
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_ext_tree, extensions = extensions)

Note how we pass an instance here, not the class of the extension.
Now we can run the transformation and see how our extension is
called::

  >>> root = etree.XML('<dummy/>')
  >>> result = transform(root)
  Hello from XSLT!
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>I did it!<child>XYZ</child></foo>\n'

XSLT extensions are a very powerful feature that allows you to
interact directly with the XSLT processor.  You have full access to
the input document and the stylesheet, and you can even call back into
the XSLT processor to process templates.  Here is an example that
passes an Element into the ``.apply_templates()`` method of the
``XSLTExtension`` instance::

  >>> class MyExtElement(etree.XSLTExtension):
  ...     def execute(self, context, self_node, input_node, output_parent):
  ...         child = self_node[0]
  ...         results = self.apply_templates(context, child)
  ...         output_parent.append(results[0])

  >>> my_extension = MyExtElement()
  >>> extensions = { ('testns', 'ext') : my_extension }
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_ext_tree, extensions = extensions)

  >>> root = etree.XML('<dummy/>')
  >>> result = transform(root)
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo><CHILD>--xyz--</CHILD></foo>\n'

Note how we applied the templates to a child of the extension element
itself, i.e. to an element inside the stylesheet instead of an element
of the input document.

There is one important thing to keep in mind: all Elements that the
``execute()`` method gets to deal with are read-only Elements, so you
cannot modify them.  They also will not easily work in the API.  For
example, you cannot pass them to the ``tostring()`` function or wrap
them in an ``ElementTree``.

What you can do, however, is to deepcopy them to make them normal
Elements, and then modify them using the normal etree API.  So this
will work::

  >>> from copy import deepcopy
  >>> class MyExtElement(etree.XSLTExtension):
  ...     def execute(self, context, self_node, input_node, output_parent):
  ...         child = deepcopy(self_node[0])
  ...         child.text = "NEW TEXT"
  ...         output_parent.append(child)

  >>> my_extension = MyExtElement()
  >>> extensions = { ('testns', 'ext') : my_extension }
  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_ext_tree, extensions = extensions)

  >>> root = etree.XML('<dummy/>')
  >>> result = transform(root)
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo><child>NEW TEXT</child></foo>\n'


The ``xslt()`` tree method
--------------------------

There's also a convenience method on ElementTree objects for doing XSL
transformations.  This is less efficient if you want to apply the same XSL
transformation to multiple documents, but is shorter to write for one-shot
operations, as you do not have to instantiate a stylesheet yourself::

  >>> result = doc.xslt(xslt_tree, a="'A'")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>A</foo>\n'

This is a shortcut for the following code::

  >>> transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)
  >>> result = transform(doc, a="'A'")
  >>> str(result)
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<foo>A</foo>\n'


Dealing with stylesheet complexity
----------------------------------

Some applications require a larger set of rather diverse stylesheets.
lxml.etree allows you to deal with this in a number of ways.  Here are
some ideas to try.

The most simple way to reduce the diversity is by using XSLT
parameters that you pass at call time to configure the stylesheets.
The ``partial()`` function in the ``functools`` module of Python 2.5
may come in handy here.  It allows you to bind a set of keyword
arguments (i.e. stylesheet parameters) to a reference of a callable
stylesheet.  The same works for instances of the ``XPath()``
evaluator, obviously.

You may also consider creating stylesheets programmatically.  Just
create an XSL tree, e.g. from a parsed template, and then add or
replace parts as you see fit.  Passing an XSL tree into the ``XSLT()``
constructor multiple times will create independent stylesheets, so
later modifications of the tree will not be reflected in the already
created stylesheets.  This makes stylesheet generation very straight
forward.

A third thing to remember is the support for `custom extension
functions`_.  Some things are much easier to do in XSLT than in
Python, while for others it is the complete opposite.  Finding the
right mixture of Python code and XSL code can help a great deal in
keeping applications well designed and maintainable.


Profiling
---------

If you want to know how your stylesheet performed, pass the ``profile_run``
keyword to the transform::

  >>> result = transform(doc, a="/a/b/text()", profile_run=True)
  >>> profile = result.xslt_profile

The value of the ``xslt_profile`` property is an ElementTree with profiling
data about each template, similar to the following::

  <profile>
    <template rank="1" match="/" name="" mode="" calls="1" time="1" average="1"/>
  </profile>

Note that this is a read-only document.  You must not move any of its elements
to other documents.  Please deep-copy the document if you need to modify it.
If you want to free it from memory, just do::

  >>> del result.xslt_profile
