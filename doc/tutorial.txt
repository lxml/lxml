This tutorial briefly overviews the main concepts of the `ElementTree API`_ as
implemented by lxml.etree, and some simple enhancements that make your life as
a programmer easier.

A common way to import ``lxml.etree`` is as follows::

    >>> from lxml import etree

If your code only uses the ElementTree API and does not rely on any
functionality that is specific to ``lxml.etree``, you can also use the
following import chain as a fall-back to the original ElementTree::

    try:
      from lxml import etree
      print "running with lxml.etree"
    except ImportError:
      try:
        # Python 2.5
        import xml.etree.cElementTree as etree
        print "running with cElementTree on Python 2.5+"
      except ImportError:
        try:
          # Python 2.5
          import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree
          print "running with ElementTree on Python 2.5+"
        except ImportError:
          try:
            # normal cElementTree install
            import cElementTree as etree
            print "running with cElementTree"
          except ImportError:
            try:
              # normal ElementTree install
              import elementtree.ElementTree as etree
              print "running with ElementTree"
            except ImportError:
              print "Failed to import ElementTree from any known place"

To aid in writing portable code, this tutorial makes it clear in the examples
which part of the presented API is an extension of lxml.etree over the
original `ElementTree API`_, as defined by Fredrik Lundh's `ElementTree
library`_.

The Element class
=================

An ``Element`` is the main container object for the ElementTree API.  Most of
the XML tree functionality is accessed through this class.  Elements are
easily created through the ``Element`` factory::

    >>> root = etree.Element("root")

The XML tag name of elements is accessed through the ``tag`` property::

    >>> print root.tag
    root

Elements are organised in an XML tree structure.  To create child elements and
add them to a parent element, you can use the ``append()`` method::

    >>> root.append( etree.Element("child1") )

However, a much more efficient and more common way to do this is through the
``SubElement`` factory.  It accepts the same arguments as the ``Element``
factory, but additionally requires the parent as first argument::

    >>> child2 = etree.SubElement(root, "child2")
    >>> child3 = etree.SubElement(root, "child3")

To see that this is really XML, you can serialise the tree you have created::

    >>> print etree.tostring(root, pretty_print=True)
    <root>
      <child1/>
      <child2/>
      <child3/>
    </root>


Elements are lists
------------------

To make the access to these subelements as easy and straight forward as
possible, elements behave exactly like normal Python lists::

    >>> child = root[0]
    >>> print child.tag
    child1

    >>> for child in root:
    ...     print child.tag
    child1
    child2
    child3

    >>> if root:
    ...     print "root has children!"
    root has children!

    >>> root.insert(0, etree.Element("child0"))
    >>> start = root[:1]
    >>> end   = root[-1:]

    >>> print start[0].tag
    child0
    >>> print end[0].tag
    child3

    >>> root[0] = root[-1]
    >>> for child in root:
    ...     print child.tag
    child3
    child1
    child2

Note how the last element was *moved* to a different position in the last
example.  This is a difference from the original ElementTree (and from lists),
where elements can sit in multiple positions of any number of trees.  In
lxml.etree, elements can only sit in one position of one tree at a time.

If you want to *copy* an element to a different position, consider creating an
independent *deep copy* using the ``copy`` module from Python's standard
library::

    >>> from copy import deepcopy

    >>> element = etree.Element("neu")
    >>> element.append( deepcopy(root[1]) )

    >>> print element[0].tag
    child1
    >>> print [ c.tag for c in root ]
    ['child3', 'child1', 'child2']

To retrieve a 'real' Python list of all children (or a *shallow copy* of the
element children list), you can call the ``getchildren()`` method::

    >>> children = root.getchildren()

    >>> print type(children) is type([])
    True

    >>> for child in children:
    ...     print child.tag
    child3
    child1
    child2

The way up in the tree is provided through the ``getparent()`` method::

    >>> root is root[0].getparent()  # lxml.etree only!
    True

The siblings (or neighbours) of an element are accessed as next and previous
elements::

    >>> root[0] is root[1].getprevious() # lxml.etree only!
    True
    >>> root[1] is root[0].getnext() # lxml.etree only!
    True


Elements carry attributes
-------------------------

XML elements support attributes.  You can create them directly in the Element
factory::

    >>> root = etree.Element("root", interesting="totally")
    >>> print etree.tostring(root)
    <root interesting="totally"/>

Fast and direct access to these attributes is provided by the ``set()`` and
``get()`` methods of elements::

    >>> print root.get("interesting")
    totally

    >>> root.set("interesting", "somewhat")
    >>> print root.get("interesting")
    somewhat

However, a very convenient way of dealing with them is through the dictionary
interface of the ``attrib`` property::

    >>> attributes = root.attrib

    >>> print attributes["interesting"]
    somewhat

    >>> print attributes.get("hello")
    None

    >>> attributes["hello"] = "Guten Tag"
    >>> print attributes.get("hello")
    Guten Tag
    >>> print root.get("hello")
    Guten Tag


Elements contain text
---------------------

Elements can contain text::

    >>> root = etree.Element("root")
    >>> root.text = "TEXT"

    >>> print root.text
    TEXT

    >>> print etree.tostring(root)
    <root>TEXT</root>

In many XML documents (so-called *data-centric* documents), this is the only
place where text can be found.  It is encapsulated by a leaf tag at the very
bottom of the tree hierarchy.

However, if XML is used for tagged text documents such as (X)HTML, text can
also appear between different elements, right in the middle of the tree::

    <html><body>Hello<br/>World</body></html>

Here, the ``<br/>`` tag is surrounded by text.  This is often referred to as
*document-style* XML.  Elements support this through their ``tail`` property.
It contains the text that directly follows the element, up to the next element
in the XML tree::

    >>> html = etree.Element("html")
    >>> body = etree.SubElement(html, "body")
    >>> body.text = "TEXT"

    >>> print etree.tostring(html)
    <html><body>TEXT</body></html>

    >>> br = etree.SubElement(body, "br")
    >>> print etree.tostring(html)
    <html><body>TEXT<br/></body></html>

    >>> br.tail = "TAIL"
    >>> print etree.tostring(html)
    <html><body>TEXT<br/>TAIL</body></html>

These two properties are enough to represent any text content in an XML
document.  If you want to read the text without the intermediate tags,
however, you have to recursively concatenate all ``text`` and ``tail``
attributes in the correct order.  A simpler way to do this is XPath_::

    >>> print html.xpath("string()") # lxml.etree only!
    TEXTTAIL
    >>> print html.xpath("//text()") # lxml.etree only!
    ['TEXT', 'TAIL']

If you want to use this more often, you can wrap it in a function::

    >>> buildTextList = etree.XPath("//text()") # lxml.etree only!
    >>> print buildTextList(html)
    ['TEXT', 'TAIL']

.. _XPath: xpathxslt.html#xpath


Tree iteration
--------------

For problems like the above, where you want to recursively traverse the tree
and do something with its elements, tree iteration is a very convenient
solution.  Elements provide a tree iterator for this purpose.  It yields
elements in *document order*, i.e. in the order their tags would appear if you
serialised the tree to XML::

    >>> root = etree.Element("root")
    >>> etree.SubElement(root, "child").text = "Child 1"
    >>> etree.SubElement(root, "child").text = "Child 2"
    >>> etree.SubElement(root, "another").text = "Child 3"

    >>> print etree.tostring(root, pretty_print=True)
    <root>
      <child>Child 1</child>
      <child>Child 2</child>
      <another>Child 3</another>
    </root>

    >>> for element in root.getiterator():
    ...     print element.tag, '-', element.text
    root - None
    child - Child 1
    child - Child 2
    another - Child 3

If you know you are only interested in a single tag, you can pass its name to
``getiterator()`` to have it filter for you::

    >>> for element in root.getiterator("child"):
    ...     print element.tag, '-', element.text
    child - Child 1
    child - Child 2

In lxml.etree, elements provide `further iterators`_ for all directions in the
tree: children, parents (or rather ancestors) and siblings.
