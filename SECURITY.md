# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

Please submit the report through the
[Launchpad bug-tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+filebug) (you may need to
create an account and log in). Make sure to mark the "ðŸ”’ This bug is a security
vulnerability" checkbox before submitting the report. This ensures the bug can only be
seen by the security group.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

This project is maintained by a few maintainers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such,
we ask that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
