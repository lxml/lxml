What is lxml?
=============

lxml is the most feature-rich and easy-to-use library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language.
It's also very fast and memory friendly, just so you know.

For an introduction and further documentation, see `doc/main.txt`_.

For installation information, see `INSTALL.txt`_.

Note that Flattr keeps 10% of the money for itself, so do not send
any larger amounts through Flattr.  Use PayPal for donations instead,
or `contact Stefan Behnel`_ for other ways to support the lxml project,
as well as commercial consulting, customisations and trainings on lxml
and fast Python XML processing.
