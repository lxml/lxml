It's also very fast and memory friendly, just so you know.

lxml has been downloaded from the `Python Package Index`_
millions of times and is also available directly in many package
distributions, e.g. for Linux or macOS.

If you are using lxml for your work and feel like giving a bit of
your own benefit back to support the project, consider sending us
money through GitHub Sponsors, Tidelift or PayPal that we can use
to buy us free time for the maintenance of this great library, to
